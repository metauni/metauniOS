These are external modules that we want to have in ReplicatedStorage.Packages

Each package in this folder must be manually linked by adding an entry to
`src/ReplicatedStorage/Packages.model.json`

Alternatively, they can be linked to anywhere else in the directory, by adding
a .project.json file where it is needed.
